# HQ9- compiler - by reetok
This is the new HQ9+ compiler.

I added a new command to it.

It can be run with "S" and when run it will say "HQ9+".

The command works only on Mac.

That's because the say command used for it works only on Mac.

If you come up with a way to work on Windows or Linux, you can contact me.
